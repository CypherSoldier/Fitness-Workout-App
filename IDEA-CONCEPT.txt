I have an idea to build a full-stack web app on my own.
This is the basic requirements I have written so far:

Explain how this can be achieved with MERN.

Absolutely, the MERN stack comprises MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, offering a robust set of tools to
 build a full-stack web application. 
Here's a breakdown of how each component can be utilized to achieve the functionalities you've outlined:

MongoDB: This NoSQL database will store user information, workout data, and any other necessary details. You can 
create collections for users, workouts, exercises, etc. 
MongoDB's flexibility is beneficial for handling diverse data types.

Express.js: This backend framework for Node.js allows you to create a robust RESTful API to handle HTTP requests 
from the frontend (React). You can define routes 
for user authentication (login/signup), retrieving/saving workouts, adding/deleting exercises, and managing user 
profiles.

React: Your frontend will be built using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface. Components 
like the login/signup page, main dashboard, navbar, user p
rofile, workout section, and exercise management can all be created as React components. React's state 
management and component-based architecture will help manage the application's state efficiently.

Node.js: This JavaScript runtime environment will power the backend of your application. You'll use it to 
run the server, handle incoming HTTP requests from 
the frontend, interact with the database (MongoDB) using Mongoose (an Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB), 
and execute various server-side logic.

To explain how your requirements map to the MERN stack:

Login/Signup Page: You'll create routes in Express.js for user authentication. MongoDB will store user 
credentials securely. React will handle the UI for user authentication forms.

Main Dashboard: Using React, create a dashboard component that displays the days of the week. You can 
fetch and display workout data for each day from the backend.

Navbar: React components will handle the navigation and link to different sections of the app. Each 
section can correspond to different routes in Express.js.

User Profile: You'll have routes in Express.js to fetch and update user profile information. React will 
render the user profile page and allow users to modify their details.

Chat/Forums: Implement real-time chat using web sockets (like Socket.IO) or utilize RESTful APIs to 
handle messaging between users. MongoDB can store chat messages.

Workouts: Use MongoDB to store various workout templates. React components will allow users to select 
and add workouts to their schedule. Express.js routes will 
handle CRUD operations for workouts and exercises.

By integrating these technologies effectively, you can create a responsive, interactive, and scalable 
web application that fulfills your outlined requirements.
